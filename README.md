IR Remote with ESP8266 (Wemos D1 mini)

Motivation: to be able to control my AC and lights when I'm away from home.
For example: to cool my room if I'm comming home on a hot summer day or to turn on the light automatically on a certain time.

# Read the AC remote codes
Parts: 
* Arduino Uno
* IR decoder TSOP38238 

I used https://www.analysir.com/blog/2014/03/19/air-conditioners-problems-recording-long-infrared-remote-control-signals-arduino/ to read the codes of the AC's remote because some ACs have a special long code. 
To read other codes I used https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote with the Arduino
